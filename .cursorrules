# Project-Specific Cursor Rules

## Communication Style
- Do NOT create any documentation unless explicitly asked
- Keep explanations minimal - provide only a bullet list abstract of tasks completed
- Avoid lengthy explanations after each task

## Code Standards
- Follow the WordPress plugin development best practices
- Maintain consistency with existing code structure
- Use React hooks and functional components for frontend
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards for PHP code
- Only lint and format the modified sections of the code; do not reformat or alter unchanged code.
